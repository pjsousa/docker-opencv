# docker-opencv
Docker container with OpenCV installed

This sets up a machine with ubuntu, python 2.7 and OpenCV 3.1.0

To use a vanilla container with just the environment do:

``` bash
docker run -it pjsousa/docker-opencv
```

To use this as a jupyter notebook server you can use [this other image](https://github.com/pjsousa/docker-jupyteropencv)
